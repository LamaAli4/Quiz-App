# 📝 Quiz App Assignment

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **single-page Quiz App** using **OOP principles in JavaScript** (ES6 classes).  
The app should display **all questions at once**, allow the user to **reset answers**, and show a **final score with pass/fail feedback** when submitted.  
The quiz should also use **localStorage** to persist answers during an active attempt, but start fresh after finishing.

## 👤 User Stories

- As a user, I want to **see all questions on the screen at once** so I can answer them in any order.
- As a user, I want each question to show **multiple options** (multiple choice or true/false) so I can select one.
- As a user, I want a **reset button** so I can clear all my answers and start again.
- As a user, I want a **submit button** so I can finish the quiz.
- As a user, I want to see my **final score out of total questions**.
- As a user, I want to see whether I **passed or failed** (e.g., pass ≥ 70%).
- As a user, I want my answers to be **saved temporarily** so that if I refresh the page during the quiz, my selected answers remain.
- As a user, once I finish the quiz and refresh, I want the app to **start fresh with empty answers**.
